**QTalk** (Quick Chat) is a modern messaging platform developed as part of the Team Challenge initiative.
The goal is to provide a responsive, real-time messaging experience powered by a clean, scalable **FSD-inspired architecture**.

## Why This Project Is Valuable for Recruiters

This project highlights skills that are directly applicable in modern frontend and full-stack roles:

- **FSD-inspired Architecture:** Uses Feature-Sliced principles (`app`, `features`, `entities`) where applicable — demonstrating a scalable, domain-oriented approach to frontend architecture.
- **Real-Time Functionality:** Demonstrates ability to design and implement WebSocket-based, event-driven UI updates.
- **TypeScript-Driven:** Shows comfort with strict typing, interfaces, and safe API contracts.
- **Modern UI/UX:** Implementation of **Shadcn/UI**, Tailwind CSS, and accessible design patterns.
- **Engineering Culture:** Configuring environment variables, proxies, aliases, and clean Git flow.
- **Decision Documentation:** Architectural decisions are explicitly documented (ADR), demonstrating engineering reasoning beyond implementation.

## Architecture Overview (FSD)

The project follows a **Feature-Sliced Design (FSD)–inspired architecture**.

This approach helps organize the codebase by business responsibility
rather than technical concerns, improving scalability and maintainability
as the application grows.

```
src/
├── app/        # Application entry point (global styles, providers)
├── pages/      # Route-level components (page composition)
├── widgets/    # Large UI blocks (e.g. ChatWindow, Sidebar)
├── features/   # User interactions (SendMessage, Auth)
├── entities/   # Core business entities (User, Message, Room)
├── shared/     # Reusable primitives (UI, API, utilities)
└── components/ # Temporary UI components (shadcn/ui integration)

```

> Note: The `components/` directory is temporary and will be gradually
> merged into the appropriate FSD layers as the project evolves.

**Key aliases:**

- `@/shared`, `@/features`, `@/app` mapping to `src/*` folders.

## UI Kit & Icons

The project uses a custom, type-safe icon system. All icons are automatically discovered and available via the unified `<Icon />` component.

**Key Features:**

- **Type-safe:** Auto-generated names provide full TypeScript autocomplete.
- **Accessible by default:** Automatically handles `aria-hidden` for decorative icons.
- **Customizable:** Fully supports Tailwind classes for size and color.

```tsx
import { Icon } from '@/shared/ui/Icon';

// Decorative icon (hidden from screen readers automatically)
<Icon name="Lock" size="md" className="text-slate-500" />

// Meaningful icon (read by screen readers)
<Icon name="Close" aria-label="Close modal" />
```

## Architectural Decision Records (ADR)

Architectural principles and key technical decisions are documented
in the `/docs/adr` directory using Architecture Decision Records (ADR).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS)
- **pnpm** (recommended)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/teamchallenge14/Teamchallenge_chat_frontend.git teamchallenge-chat-frontend
cd teamchallenge-chat-frontend
```

2. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
pnpm install
```

3. **Environment Setup:**
   Create a `.env` file in the root:

```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000/api
VITE_WS_URL=ws://localhost:3000
```

_(Note: Local development uses Vite Proxy to handle CORS automatically)._

4. **Run Locally:**

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173` to view the app.

## Code Quality Gates (Standard Established)

This project now enforces the following **Code Quality Gates**:

### Static Analysis & Type Safety

- **ESLint (Flat Config)** with strict rules enabled via `@typescript-eslint`
- Disallows unsafe patterns such as:
  - non-null assertions (`!`)
  - unused variables and parameters
  - unchecked side effects
- Ensures consistent and predictable code structure across the project

### Formatting Consistency

- **Prettier** is integrated with ESLint
- Formatting issues are treated as linting errors
- **Tailwind CSS class sorting** is enforced automatically via plugin
- Guarantees a uniform code style regardless of contributor

## How to Test

Reviewers can verify the setup by running the following commands:

1. Check for linting errors (should be clean):

```bash
pnpm lint
```

2. Check formatting:

```bash
pnpm format
```
